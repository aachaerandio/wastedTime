WastedTime is an app aims to help you realise how much time you waste in some situations. 

You will have a chronometer and a list of your tracks, so you can check your times and have the ability to share them on your favourite social networks. 

To start, press the big icon button and start running.
Meanwhile the chronometer is running you can choose an icon that fits your situation.
Stop the chronometer, write a title and save your time.
Check your times in the list. With a long-press you can select several items at the same time for deleted them or select one of them to share in social media.

This is my first app for android but not the last, hope you enjoy using it as much I did developing it!
